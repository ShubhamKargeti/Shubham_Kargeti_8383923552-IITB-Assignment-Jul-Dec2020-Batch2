23/Aug -- I have never created synthetic dataset so I spent whole day to find out how all the text generator repository works and then how to convert it into tf.records and so I read the repositories and tried to understand how it worls now I think I have finally figure out everything about creating dataset so now I am going to create it tommorow.
24/Aug -- I spent my whole day figuring out working of synthetic data repository I still can not figure out how to calculate depth and segment for my image and also that repository works for linux so trying to figure out how to use it for window,maybe tomorrow I will figure it out and then will train the model.
25/Aug -- Today I have created the traininig data and also have converted it to tf.records to train the model the difficulties I faced today were creating bounding box around text for which I was lookin for it in given repository but I couldn't find it so I manually created it with right parameters.
26/Aug -- Today I spent my day on training the data on original model It took a lot of time.The difficulties were that the whole model was built on TF version-1 which is outdated now so it was generating a lot of error so I read the whole code and manually corrected some part of it according to my requirements, now it is working fine so I am training my dataset on it.
27/Aug -- Today was not very productive day.I used the model link given in the document but because of some reason the model was not converging I spent almost full day to recognise the problem but I couldn't as it was in tensorflow version-1 so I decided to find a new model with pytorch so I tried 1-2 of them but couldn't impliment them because I dont have a gpu in my laptop and to train the model I needed to use google colab and those model needed raw images for training and importing 50k train images to colab was not possible. So I am creating a new model which will use tfrecord as training data which I will be able to import in colab and I think I will compleate it by morning.
28/Aug -- It took full day to made the model for tfrecord dataset the main probem I faces was the converting tfrecord to image and label that could be load into a dataloader it was giving lot of errors and it took lot of time ressolving those errors but the model is done now and I am gonna train the model tommorow.
