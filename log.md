I have never created dataset on my owm so I spent whole day to find out how all the text generator repository works and then how to convert it into tf.records and now I have finally figure out everything about creating dataset so now I am going to create it.
I spend my whole day figuring out working of synthetic data repository I still can not figure out how to depth and segment for my image and also that repository works for linux so trying to figure out how to use it for window,maybe tomorrow I will figure it out and then will train the model.
Today I have created the traininig data and also have converted it to tf.records to train the model the difficulties I faced today were creating bounding box around text for which I was lookin for it in given repository but I couldn't find it so I manually created it with right parameters.
