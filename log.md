23/Aug -- I have never created synthetic dataset so I spent whole day to find out how all the text generator repository works and then how to convert it into tf.records and so I read the repositories and tried to understand how it worls now I think I have finally figure out everything about creating dataset so now I am going to create it tommorow.
24/Aug -- I spent my whole day figuring out working of synthetic data repository I still can not figure out how to calculate depth and segment for my image and also that repository works for linux so trying to figure out how to use it for window,maybe tomorrow I will figure it out and then will train the model.
25/Aug -- Today I have created the traininig data and also have converted it to tf.records to train the model the difficulties I faced today were creating bounding box around text for which I was lookin for it in given repository but I couldn't find it so I manually created it with right parameters.
26/Aug -- Today I spent my day on training the data on original model It took a lot of time.The difficulties were that the whole model was built on TF version-1 which is outdated now so it was generating a lot of error so I read the whole code and manually corrected some part of it according to my requirements, now it is working fine so I am training my dataset on it.
